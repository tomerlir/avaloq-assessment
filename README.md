### Design Pattern in Java
Following the proper procedures and Java instillations completed in the first part (FizzBuzz), navigate to the DesignPattern directory.
For my Design Pattern, I have decided to use the Bridge pattern, which is used to basically decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that they can vary independently.
Again, depending on whether you are viewing via IDE or terminal, you may run the program respectively: 
With the run method of the IDE
Or by typing in your terminal
```
javac BridgePatternProgram.java
java BridgePatternProgram
```
Output is the solution to the Design Pattern problem.
